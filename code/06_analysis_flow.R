## going through Arya's analysis help map 

#two sample - sampled paired 
#-2 one sample t-test and compare } treat set of differences as one sample 

#two sample - samples independent 
# - two sample t-test with pooled variance term? (normal distribution, normal variance)
# - welch two sample t-test, no pooled variances (normal distribution, unequal variances)
# - mann-whitney or wilcoxon signed rank test (very non normally distributed, but similar distribution shapes/variances)
# - transformation / reasses / descriptive statistics (one/both very non normally distributed, without similated variances)

#can we do more than 2 samples with the mixed plate? wouldnt make any sense
## one predictor variable (r* or treatment - categorical?) ( or more than?) - categorical or continuous?
## - one variable (categorical): some type of ANOVA if there is equal or unequal variance, Kruskal wallis for non normal distribution and similar variance
## - multiple categorical == two factor anova

##might not be able to get growth rates from this data - keep getting negative growth, everything dying
##try fitting to monod curve
