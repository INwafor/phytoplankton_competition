##worrk on second experiment trial 
# Rstar for Phosphate

##plan: start by making each of the sheets into a data frame - join those all together - thats one file of code
## next file make a path from this code and organize/clean up the data frame by species, make times/dates correct
## path from that code to make a new one that plots the R* by temperature and use that to analyze 
## finally one last script to work on the monod curves and fitting the data to growth models
